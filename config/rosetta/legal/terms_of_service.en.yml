        # Terms of Service

        **Effective: 26 October 2025**

        Welcome to Fluck. These are the rules for using our service. We've tried to keep them as straightforward and human-readable as possible.

        By using Fluck, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use our service.

        - **VAT ID:** ES B22475495
        - **Address:** Apdo. de Correos 820, 30599, Altea, Spain

        ## Your account

        ### Creating an account
        To use Fluck, you need to create an account. You must:
        - Be at least 16 years old
        - Provide accurate information
        - Keep your password secure
        - Not share your account with others

        You're responsible for everything that happens through your account.

        ### Your subscription
        We offer monthly and annual subscriptions. You can cancel anytime. If you cancel:
        - You keep access until the end of your billing period
        - We won't charge you again
        - Your sites will be taken offline unless you export them or switch to self-hosting

        We may change our pricing, but we'll give you at least 30 days notice and honour your current price for the remainder of your billing period.

        ## What you can do

        ### Build your website
        You can create websites, portfolios, shops, and blogs using Fluck. You own all the content you create.

        ### Export your data
        You can export your entire site at any time. When we launch the self-hosting option (planned for late 2026), you can take your site and run it yourself.

        ### Use our code
        When Fluck goes open source (planned for late 2026), you can use, modify, and distribute our code under the terms of the open-source licence we choose. We'll announce the specific licence before launch.

        ## What you can't do

        Don't use Fluck to:
        - Break the law
        - Harm others
        - Distribute malware or viruses
        - Spam people
        - Violate anyone's intellectual property rights
        - Host content that's illegal, pornographic, or promotes violence or hate
        - Scrape, reverse engineer, or attempt to hack our service
        - Resell or redistribute Fluck without our explicit permission

        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.

        ## Your content

        ### You own it
        Everything you create with Fluck is yours. We don't claim any ownership over your content.

        ### Our licence to your content
        To provide the service, you grant us permission to:
        - Store and display your content
        - Backup your content
        - Process it as needed to run the service

        This licence ends when you delete your content or close your account.

        ### Your responsibility
        You're responsible for:
        - Making sure you have the right to use any content you upload
        - Complying with laws regarding your content
        - Any legal issues arising from your content

        We're not responsible for content you create or upload.

        ## Payments

        ### Processing
        We use Mollie to process payments. By subscribing, you agree to their terms as well as ours.

        ### Refunds
        We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for new subscriptions. After that, no refunds, but you can cancel anytime.

        ### Taxes
        Prices don't include VAT or other applicable taxes. These will be added at checkout based on your location.

        ## Our service

        ### Availability
        We work hard to keep Fluck running smoothly, but we can't guarantee 100% uptime. We may need to suspend the service for:
        - Maintenance
        - Upgrades
        - Emergency repairs
        - Technical issues beyond our control

        We'll try to minimize disruptions and give notice when possible.

        ### Changes
        We may:
        - Add new features
        - Remove or modify existing features
        - Change how the service works

        We'll notify you of significant changes, especially if they might affect your sites.

        ### Backups
        We back up your data regularly, but you should too. We're not liable for data loss, though we'll do everything possible to prevent it.

        ## Intellectual property

        ### Our stuff
        Fluck's code, design, branding, and documentation are ours (or our licensors). You can't use them without permission, except as these terms allow.

        ### Your stuff
        Your content is yours. You're free to do whatever you want with it.

        ### Open source
        When we go open source, our code will be available under an open-source licence. Until then, all rights are reserved.

        ## AI and scraping

        We prohibit:
        - Scraping content from Fluck or from websites built with Fluck
        - Using scraped content to train AI models, language models, or machine learning systems
        - Automated data collection without explicit permission

        User websites built with Fluck may set their own policies via robots.txt and terms of service.

        ## Termination

        ### By you
        You can close your account anytime through your account settings. Your data will be permanently deleted within 30 days.

        ### By us
        We may suspend or terminate your account if you:
        - Violate these terms
        - Use the service fraudulently
        - Cause technical or security issues
        - Don't pay your subscription

        We'll try to warn you first, but we reserve the right to act immediately if necessary.

        ## Disclaimers and limitations

        ### No warranties
        Fluck is provided "as is." We don't guarantee:
        - Uninterrupted or error-free service
        - That it'll meet all your needs
        - That it's completely secure (though we try hard)
        - That all features will work perfectly all the time

        ### Limitation of liability
        To the maximum extent permitted by law:
        - We're not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
        - Our total liability is limited to what you paid us in the last 12 months
        - We're not liable for things outside our control

        **This doesn't limit liability that can't be limited by law, such as for fraud, death, or personal injury caused by our negligence.**

        ### Your responsibility
        You're responsible for:
        - How you use Fluck
        - Your content and websites
        - Compliance with laws
        - Any damages resulting from your breach of these terms

        ## General stuff

        ### Changes to these terms
        We may update these terms. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you by email at least 30 days in advance. Continued use after changes means you accept them.

        ### Entire agreement
        These terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between us.

        ### Severability
        If any part of these terms is found unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.

        ### No waiver
        Our failure to enforce any right doesn't mean we've waived it.

        ### Assignment
        You can't transfer your rights under these terms. We can transfer ours if we need to restructure our business legally, but your rights won't be affected.

        ### Contact
        Questions? Email us at info@fluck.site. We're real people and happy to help.

        ## Law and jurisdiction

        These terms are governed by Spanish law. 

        If you're a consumer, you keep any mandatory rights under the consumer protection laws of your country. Nothing here removes those rights.

        For disputes:
        - **Consumers:** You can bring legal action in the courts of your country or Spain
        - **Businesses:** Disputes will be handled exclusively in the courts of Valencia, Spain
