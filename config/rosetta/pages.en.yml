        We are a small team based in Valencia, Spain. We're independent and
        100% self-funded, with the rather ambitious goal of making artists,
        designers, and makers less dependent on corporate platforms for their
        web presence.

            out of your way, without unnecessary fluff.

          We want to help artists and designers make their work sustainable. As
          we grow, we plan to distribute a portion of our profits as grants to
          support artists and designers. Fluck is just the beginning.
          Supporting the creative community is the bigger goal.
