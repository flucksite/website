      story:
        title: Why we're building Fluck
        text: >-
          **For nearly a decade, we've carried this idea to create a better
          website builder for artists and designers.** Every time we needed to
          set up a website or online shop for a project, it felt harder than it
          should. The tools were either too complex, too expensive, or simply
          not the right fit. But each time we sat down to seriously evaluate
          building a new platform, we bottled it. The effort seemed enormous,
          and taking on the tech giants felt impossible.


          Then things changed.


          By 2025, Big Tech had stopped pretending to care. The mask slipped
          completely, cosying up to authoritarians, accelerating inequality,
          and turning creativity into content for their algorithms to sell more
          ads. More and more people began looking for alternatives. That shift
          in sentiment was our signal to finally build Fluck.


          We reject everything Big Tech represents: black boxes, invasive
          algorithms, prioritizing shareholders over users, and pure corporate
          greed. We want to help reclaim the web that was once a place of
          genuine discovery and opportunity, before it became an extraction
          machine.


          Is it still a massive undertaking? Absolutely. Do we still face
          Goliath-sized competitors? Of course. But now there's something
          different: a growing movement of creators who are fed up with being
          exploited by platforms that don't understand or respect what they do.


          It's still small, but it's real, and that's more than enough to fuel
          this journey.


          Mick and Wout
