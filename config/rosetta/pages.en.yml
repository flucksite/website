      story:
        title: Why we're building Fluck
        text: >-
          **For nearly a decade, we've carried this idea to create a better
          website builder for artists and designers.** Every time we needed to
          set up a website or online shop for a project, it felt harder than it
          should. The tools were either too complex, too expensive, or simply
          not the right fit. But each time we sat down to seriously evaluate
          building a new platform, we bottled it. The effort seemed enormous,
          and taking on the tech giants felt impossible.


          Then things changed.


          By 2025, Big Tech had stopped pretending to care. The mask slipped
          completely, cosying up to authoritarians, accelerating inequality,
          and turning creativity into content for their algorithms to sell more
          ads. More and more people began looking for alternatives. That shift
          in sentiment was our signal to finally build Fluck.


          We reject everything Big Tech represents: black boxes, invasive
          algorithms, prioritizing shareholders over users, and pure corporate
          greed. We want to help reclaim the web that was once a place of
          genuine discovery and opportunity, before it became an extraction
          machine.


          Is it still a massive undertaking? Absolutely. Do we still face
          Goliath-sized competitors? Of course. But now there's something
          different: a growing movement of creators who are fed up with being
          exploited by platforms that don't understand or respect what they do.


          It's still small, but it's real, and that's more than enough to fuel
          this journey.


          Mick and Wout

        We're planning to welcome our first users at the beginning of 2026 for a

          At the start of 2026, we'll begin inviting the first people into our
          closed beta. This won't be a mass rollout, we're starting small and
          deliberate. We'll work with each person individually to help them get
          set up, whether you're building a new site or moving from another
          platform.

        title: Interested?

          Subscribe here, and we'll notify you when we are ready to get you
          settled in. Until then, you'll receive a monthly-ish newsletter for
          early birds.

          Here's our rough timeline. These are targets, not promises, and dates
          may shift as we go because we're a small team. The earlier you join,
          the more influence you'll have on how Fluck develops. Active beta
          users who provide feedback will also receive a lifetime free account.

            **Closed beta begins.** We'll start sending personal invitations to
            the first people on the waitlist. Expect some bugs and features
            that aren't fully polished yet.

            **Ramping up invites.** We'll bring in more users, but still keep
            the one-on-one onboarding process.

            **Opening to the public.** The beta opens up, but signups will
            still be batched so we can monitor our infrastructure and make sure
            it holds up under load.
        public_beta_2:
          title: 'September 2026'
          text: >-
            **Bigger batches.** We'll increase the number of users we invite at
            once as our systems prove stable.
        version_1:
          title: 'November 2026'
          text: >-
            **Version 1.0 launches.** Registration opens to everyone. The
            self-hostable version becomes available, and Fluck goes fully open
            source.
